Contructed a restaurant finder tool with a functional swiping system. This has a built in user system with information stored in an API backend. Each logged in user has the capability to place a restaurant on their favorite's list, or blacklist it from future searches. Users can select a specific set of restaurants with filters such as distance from restaurant, price, and cuisine type. Searching for users also has a built in auto complete feature that gives options for local restaurants. Restaurants and information are taken from yelps API.
